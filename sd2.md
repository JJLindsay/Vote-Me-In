#Choosing between xml and JSON
<hr/>

For my project I created an application that would communicate with a JSON or XML backend. I say 'or' because I played around with both ideas initially. I found them both to incredibly useful in their own right but I will be using this paper to expalin why I chose to use XLM over JSON in the end.

WHAT IS JSON?

JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.

As a simple example, information about me might be written in JSON as follows:

What is XML?

So, what is XML? Whenever a group of people asks this question, I always look at the individuals’ body language. A significant portion of the group leans forward eagerly, wanting to learn more. The others either roll their eyes in anticipation of hype and half-formed theories, or cringe in fear of a long, dry history of markup languages. As a result, I’ve learned to keep my explanation brief.

The essence of XML is in its name: Extensible Markup Language.
