#Choosing between xml and JSON
<hr/>

For my project I created an application that would communicate with a JSON or XML backend. I say 'or' because I played around with both ideas initially. I found them both to incredibly useful in their own right but I will be using this paper to expalin why I chose to use XLM over JSON in the end.
